                <p>Japanese rice refers to a number of short-grain cultivars of Japonica rice including ordinary
                    rice and glutinous rice. Ordinary Japanese rice, is the staple of the Japanese diet and consists of short
                    translucent grains. When cooked, it has a sticky texture such that it can easily be picked up and eaten with chopsticks.
                    Glutinous rice, is used for making special dishes such as sekihan. It is a short-grain rice, and can be distinguished from
                    uruchimai by its particularly short, round, opaque grains, its greater stickness when cooked, and firmer and chewier texture.

                    Ramen is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat fish-based broth,
                     often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as sliced pork dried seaweed, menma and scallions.

                      such as the pork bone broth ramen of Kyushu, and the miso ramen of Hokkaido
